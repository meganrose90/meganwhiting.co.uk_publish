      <description>With wedding season fast approaching, I thought it might be helpful to talk about my personalised poetry in a little more detail.
More often than not, I’m contacted by brides looking for a bespoke poem to take the place of a reading at their wedding ceremony, but I’ve also written poems for key members of the wedding party to give the newlyweds as a unique gift! Printed on parchment-style paper, the poems look lovely when framed.</description>

      <description>It’s safe to say that self-employment and working from home can be challenging at times…!
Below are 30 tips I’ve pulled together for the benefit of fellow self-employed folk; especially those who are new to this lifestyle.
So, without further ado…
Tip 1 Try to get up at a similar (and sensible!) time each morning. When your workspace is a mere few metres away, it can be tempting to stay in bed a little longer, but it’s important to establish a routine.</description>

      <description>Book Benefits I’ve found comfort and enjoyment in books for as long as I can remember, and, fortunately for me, as a writer, proofreader and editor, I get to read on a daily basis! Luckily, reading as part of my job hasn’t quelled my appetite for books and I still read an awful lot; for pleasure, escapism and as a way of de-stressing!
Even now, I come across words I feel compelled to look up; either because they’re unfamiliar, or I’m not sure how to pronounce them, as I’ve only ever seen them written down&amp;hellip; !</description>

      <description>It’s the start of a new year! Have you made any resolutions?
Perhaps you’re planning to self-publish the book you spent most of 2018 writing, but know that it needs a little fine-tuning, in the form of a proofread or edit?
It’s important to understand that although proofreading and editing have their similarities, there are key differences between the two.
I provide both services, but you may come across professionals specialising in either proofreading or editing, so it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the terms.</description>
